Let’s zero in—**pure cognitive load + layout optimization**, no feature creep, no new systems, no extra charts.
Just *how to arrange what you already have* so the brain “breathes” instead of “buffers.”

---

# **THE CORE PROBLEM (What’s Hurting Users Right Now)**

Your UI is **beautiful**, but cognitively **dense**:

* Too many full-width panels stacked vertically
* High semantic load above the fold
* Insufficient grouping / chunking
* No compression of “set it and forget it” sections
* Heavy sections (Evidence, Confidence, Interactions Detail) have equal visual weight
* Heatmap → Sliders → Metrics → Charts → Surface → Recommendations → Optimizer = a **long, unbroken cognitive marathon**

None of these are “bad” individually.
Together, they create **friction**.

So let’s fix it by restructuring—not removing—content.

---

# **GOAL: Make physioLab feel as lightweight as Apple Health, as structured as Bloomberg, and as analytical as a lab report.**

We’ll do it in three layers:

1. **Macro Layout (page-wide structure)**
2. **Mesostructure (section organization, chunking, collapsibility)**
3. **Micro-Load (visual cues, typography, spacing, grouping)**

Let’s go layer by layer.

---

# **1. MACRO LAYOUT (Solve the vertical sprawl)**

The biggest win: change how the page flows.

Right now the layout is one long column.
That forces:
**→ sequential cognition
→ high vertical search cost
→ no “resting points”**

### **Fix: Break the page into three clear horizontal “zones”**

### **Zone 1 — Personalization Card (Collapsible Header)**

This should collapse automatically after setup to a **single-line profile bar**.

Collapsed state:

```
Profile: 30 y • 190 lb • 5y training • SHBG 30 • Arom: Mod • Anxiety: Mod • Experience: Blast/BW 
[Edit]
```

This reduces vertical load by ~40%, and removes a huge chunk of “static options” from constant visual attention.

---

### **Zone 2 — Tabs Section (Injectables / Orals / Interactions / Stack Builder)**

This should always begin immediately after the collapsed profile bar—no filler above.
Tabs anchor the workflow.

---

### **Zone 3 — Content Panel (Scroll Zone)**

Each tab should take over the viewport with its own dedicated screen structure.
This makes everything *contextual* instead of “one giant dashboard.”

---

# **2. MESOSTRUCTURE (Chunking, Reduction, Hierarchy)**

Now let’s refine what’s **inside** each tab to reduce cognitive burden.

---

## **A. Injectables / Orals Tabs**

### **Current Problem**

You’re stacking:

* toggles
* main chart
* quick guide
* scenarios
* evidence tier
* evidence & confidence cards

That’s 6 major concepts on one page.
This is unnecessary load.

---

## **New Layout (Massively Lower Load)**

### **Section 1 — Display Controls (Compact Row)**

Put “Show: Benefit/Risk” and “Find my sweet spot” **in a single thin control bar** ABOVE the chart.

### **Section 2 — Main Chart (Dominant, Hero Element)**

The user’s eye should land HERE.
No other competing sections at the same vertical level.

### **Section 3 — Utility Drawer (Collapsed by default)**

Replace Quick Guide, Evidence Tier System, Common Scenarios with:

### **“Need context?” – Expand to learn**

A single card that expands into:

* Quick Guide
* Common Scenarios
* Evidence Tiers

This reduces 3 cards into 1.

### **Section 4 — Evidence & Confidence Layer (Moves to its own tab or collapsible section)**

This block is *incredible* but heavy.
It should be collapsed by default or exist under a dedicated “Evidence” tab.

As it stands, it is *way too cognitively rich* to appear in the middle of the flow.

---

# **B. Interactions Tab (Most overloaded part)**

Interactions is where 70% of cognitive load hits.
Let’s smooth it out.

### **Current Flow**

* Full matrix
* Pair header
* Dose sliders
* Metrics
* Line chart
* Surface grid
* Recommendations
* Optimizer

This is 8 distinct “modes of thinking” with no breaks.

---

## **New Layout (Chunked)**

### **Chunk 1 — Interaction Matrix (Full Width, but Shorter)**

Add a small caption:

**“Click a pair to model dose synergy (Test × NPP)”**

After a cell is selected, **auto-scroll** to the pair detail.
Do NOT keep the matrix in view when analyzing a pair.
This alone reduces 20–30% load.

---

### **Chunk 2 — Selected Pair Summary (Sticky Header)**

Make a slim sticky panel appear:

```
Test × NPP • Goal: Lean Mass • Evidence: 65% Clinical / 35% Anecdotal
```

This orients the user as they scroll.

---

### **Chunk 3 — Dose Controls (Side-by-side)**

Right now sliders span horizontally, but they still form a tall block.

Make the left column:

* Primary compound slider
* Secondary slider
* Dimension chip row

Make the right column:

* Noise sum
* Interaction delta
* Total modeled
* Shape saturation

This cuts vertical space in half.

---

### **Chunk 4 — Primary Dose Sweep Chart (Full width)**

Leave this as is—strong visual anchor.

---

### **Chunk 5 — Dose Surface + Recommendations (Two-Column Layout)**

Left column: heatmap grid
Right column: recommendations (#1–#4)

Users understand relationships faster when visual + prescription sit side by side.

---

### **Chunk 6 — Multi-Compound Optimizer (Own Section, Collapsed by Default)**

This section is *valuable*, but too much for casual users.

Default it to collapsed:

**“Advanced: Multi-Compound Synergy Explorer ▾”**

---

# **3. MICRO-LOAD (Spacing, typography, small wins)**

These are tiny refinements with big perceptual impacts.

### **A. Reduce vertical padding in section headers (10–12px)**

Currently sections are “billboard tall.”
Reduce padding to increase density without overwhelming.

---

### **B. Use lighter dividers**

Thin (1px, 10% opacity) dividers between major chunks give the brain segmentation points without feeling heavy.

---

### **C. Add ghost labels / annotations**

Example:
On the surface heatmap:

Add “A dose →” on x-axis and “↑ B dose” on y-axis.
Even faint labels massively reduce orientation effort.

---

### **D. Align everything to an 8px grid**

Your UI mostly does this, but a few padding blocks (especially in Interaction detail cards) break grid rhythm and increase cognitive friction.

---

# **THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE YOU CAN MAKE**

### **Collapse the Personalization Header after first setup.**

Users should see the chart or matrix immediately on returning.
Right now the entire top of the app is a cognitive speed bump.

This change alone makes the whole product feel:

* lighter
* faster
* more intentional
* more “professional tool / less website”

---

# **TL;DR — Cognitive Load & Layout Improvements**

### **1. Collapse big blocks after setup (Personalization, Guides, Evidence).**

### **2. Use “expand to learn” sections to hide depth by default.**

### **3. Break the Interactions tab into 5–6 digestible chunks.**

### **4. Side-by-side columns wherever possible → halve vertical scrolling.**

### **5. Add sticky mini-bars for orientation.**

### **6. Treat the main chart / main pair detail as the “hero” in each tab.**

Implement just these 10 changes and the app becomes **twice as easy to navigate** without removing a single feature.
