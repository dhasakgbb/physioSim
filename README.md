## 🎯 Overview

This interactive visualization tool presents dose-response relationships for **11 anabolic-androgenic steroids** (6 injectables + 5 orals) with explicit evidence grounding, uncertainty quantification, and comprehensive stack planning capabilities. Built for harm reduction education, it transparently shows:

- **Benefit curves** (anabolic gains: mass, strength, tissue development)
- **Risk curves** (aggregate side burden: lipids, cardio, psych, organ stress)
- **Uncertainty bands** (confidence intervals proportional to evidence quality)
- **Evidence tiers** (Tier 1-4: human RCTs → anecdotal patterns)
- **Compound interactions** (38 interaction pairs with synergy calculations)
- **Stack metrics** (benefit:risk ratios with interaction modifiers)
- **Ancillary protocols** (automated harm reduction recommendations)

### Core Philosophy

**Transparency over false precision.** Every data point is tagged with its evidence tier, source, and confidence interval. Wide uncertainty bands communicate "we don't know well" rather than hiding limitations.

### What's New in v2.0

- ✨ **5 Oral Compounds**: Dianabol, Anadrol, Winstrol, Anavar, Halotestin
- 🔗 **Interaction Matrix**: 38 compound interaction pairs with detailed analysis
- 🧪 **Stack Builder**: Build multi-compound stacks with automated synergy calculations
- ⚠️ **Side Effect Profiles**: Comprehensive side effect data for all 11 compounds
- 💊 **Ancillary Calculator**: Automated protocol generation with cost estimates and blood work schedules

  const benefit500 = tren.benefitCurve.find(p => p.dose === 500);
  const benefit600 = tren.benefitCurve.find(p => p.dose === 600);
  
  expect(benefit400.value).toBeCloseTo(4.87, 2);
  expect(benefit500.value).toBe(benefit400.value); // FLAT
  expect(benefit600.value).toBe(benefit400.value); // FLAT

## 📖 Methodology

### Evidence Hierarchy

**Tier 1: Empirical Human Data** (Highest Confidence)
- Randomized controlled trials at specific doses
- Example: Bhasin et al. Test 0-600mg

**Tier 2: Clinical/Therapeutic Human Data** (High Confidence)
- Therapeutic doses extrapolated via pharmacology
- Example: Nandrolone 50-100mg clinical use

**Tier 3: Animal Studies + HED Scaling** (Medium Confidence)
- Animal dose-response converted to human equivalent
- Formula: HED = Animal Dose × (Animal Km / Human Km)
- Example: Yarrow Tren rat study scaled to human

**Tier 4: Mechanism + Anecdotal Patterns** (Lower Confidence)
- Pharmacological theory + community reports
- High bias (survivorship, reporting, confounders)
- Example: Tren plateau at 300mg (forum consensus)

### Risk Scoring Formula

```
Risk(X) = 0.3 × Risk_lipid(X) 
        + 0.3 × Risk_cardio(X) 
        + 0.2 × Risk_psych(X) 
        + 0.1 × Risk_hepatic(X) 
        + 0.1 × Risk_suppression(X)
```

Normalized to 0-5.5 scale for visual comparison with benefit curves.

### Assumptions Baked In

- Male, age 25-40
- Proper AI/SERM use (not modeled separately)
- Training/diet adequate (not limiting factor)
- No pre-existing HTN, dyslipidemia, cardiac disease
- Duration: 12-16 week cycles (not chronic year-round)
- PCT protocol followed

**Individual variance: ±20-30% typical** (genetics, compliance, health status)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

### HARM REDUCTION MODELING, NOT MEDICAL ADVICE

This tool visualizes dose-response relationships based on limited human data, animal studies, and community patterns. **It is educational only** and does not constitute medical, pharmaceutical, or health advice.

**Key Points:**
- These compounds are controlled substances in most jurisdictions
- Individual responses vary widely (±20-30% typical); **your response may differ**
- Risk curves are modeled, not empirically measured, at most doses
- **Consult a healthcare provider before using AAS**
- This tool assumes proper ancillary use, training, diet, and baseline health

**What This Tool Is NOT:**
- ❌ A prescription for dosing
- ❌ A guarantee of specific outcomes
- ❌ Validated for your individual physiology
- ❌ A replacement for medical supervision

**What This Tool IS:**
- ✅ A thinking tool for understanding tradeoffs
- ✅ A harm reduction resource showing diminishing returns
- ✅ A transparent model with explicit uncertainty
- ✅ An educational framework for risk-aware decision-making

### No Overclaiming Language

This tool avoids:
- "Optimal dose is X" → Instead: "appears to peak around X±Y"
- "The science shows" → Instead: "based on available evidence"
- "Proven" → Instead: "modeled based on theory + patterns"

For Tier 4 data, explicit warnings:
- "Speculative" or "high uncertainty"
- "No human data; modeled from animal studies + community reports"
- "Treat as hypothesis, not established fact"
